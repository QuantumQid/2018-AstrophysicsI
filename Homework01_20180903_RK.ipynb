    "A CCD detector at the focal plane of a 1-m-diameter telescope records the image of a certain star. Due to the blurring effect of the atmosphere (this is called the \"seeing\" by astronomers) the light from the star is spread over a circular area of radius R pixels. The total number of photoelectrons over the area, accumulated during the exposure, and due to the light of the stars, is $N_s$. Light from the sky prduces $n_s$ photoelectrons per pixel in the same exposure."
